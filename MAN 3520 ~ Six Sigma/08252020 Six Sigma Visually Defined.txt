Six Sigma Defined Visually

	Smuckers Uncrustables

		Identifying & controlling sources of variation in ingredients & baking processes for each sandwich during production are key process variables
			y=f(x)
			y = net sandwich weight
			x = how much?
				Jelly
				Peanaut butter
				Bread
				Sandwich dimensions

Sigma Levels
	- Sigma levels are variation
	- Example: In a 2 sigma process, 95% of the measured values taken in a process will be within two standard deviations from the process average
	- The level represents the number of sigmas away from the mean the standard deviation is
	- Lower and upper limit are determined by the customer

DMAIC vs DMADV
	DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control
		- Course focus
		- Improve existing processes
	DMADV: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design,  Verify
		- Part of Design for Six Sigma
		- Develop new processes

Six Sigma projects are characterized by predefined phases â€“ depending on the type of product or business

DMAIC - Define
	During Define, primary objectives are to understand whether this is the right project and the best project to do right now
	- Project scope is clear
	- Customer/market value is understood
	- Business value is understood
	- Process performance measures are agreed upon and baselined
	- Business support for project in place (project leader and team)
	- Champions & process owners in place to remove barriers
