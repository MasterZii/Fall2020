Week 2

Executive summary: Research on something and provide a brief synopsis. What are the main points and ideas of the article? What is one key takeaway?


Six Sigma Defined Visually

	Smuckers Uncrustables

		Identifying & controlling sources of variation in ingredients & baking processes for each sandwich during production are key process variables
			y=f(x)
			y = net sandwich weight
			x = how much?
				Jelly
				Peanaut butter
				Bread
				Sandwich dimensions

Sigma Levels
	- Sigma levels are variation
	- Example: In a 2 sigma process, 95% of the measured values taken in a process will be within two standard deviations from the process average
	- The level represents the number of sigmas away from the mean the standard deviation is
	- Lower and upper limit are determined by the customer

DMAIC vs DMADV
	DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control
		- Course focus
		- Improve existing processes
	DMADV: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design,  Verify
		- Part of Design for Six Sigma
		- Develop new processes

Six Sigma projects are characterized by predefined phases â€“ depending on the type of product or business

DMAIC is a methodology for improvement projects and the backbone for Six Sigma. 
	Define - 
		What is the problem? How often does it happen? What is the impact of the problem? Who's in the team? How will it be run?
	Measure - 
		How do we measure the problem? How do we measure it? How reliable is the data? What is the current performance?
	Analyse - 
		How does the process work? What does our knowledge of the process tell us? What does the data say? Can the data verify that the cause affects the output?
	Improve - 
		What are all possible solutions? Which will work best? When, where, and how can this be implemented?
	Control - 
		Has the goal been achieved? Are the improvements standardized?

DMAIC 
- Define
	During Define, primary objectives are to understand whether this is the right project and the best project to do right now
	- Project scope is clear
	- Customer/market value is understood
	- Business value is understood
	- Process performance measures are agreed upon and baselined
	- Business support for project in place (project leader and team)
	- Champions & process owners in place to remove barriers
	SIPOC: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Output, Customers
		- Used for understanding the scope and purpose of the process
		- Takes about an hour

- Measure
	Team gets much deeper understanding of current process; how it has performed in the past and current performance
	- Team works to understand current state of process through use of mapping tools
	- Focus on reliability of primary performance metric
	- Once baseline is confirmed, if team finds any quick hits, they can be addressed right away
