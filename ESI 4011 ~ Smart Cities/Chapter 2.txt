Four questions to determine if a system is a system:
	Does it have clarity of purpose?
	Are the major elements connected?
	Can we determine the status at any time?
	Can it adapt to changes in the environment?

Safety questions:
	How do we maximize the safety of the transportation system?

Efficiency questions:
	Where are the bottlenecks and slowdowns in the transportation system?
	How do I optimize the efficiency of my transportation system?
	How are transportation assets performing and how can they be managed better?

What impact will connected and autonomous vehicles have on the transportation system?
