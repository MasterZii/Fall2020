The MBTA in Boston is currently piloting a program with ridesharing companies (Uber, Lyft, and Curb) for on-demand paratransit services to RIDE, the MBTA's paratransit partner, customers. Using their phone, people can book trips as low as $2 that are paid to the appropriate service (Uber, Lyft, or Curb). This partnership offers shorter wait times, instant and same-day booking, faster trips, and wheelchair accessible vehicles. The program is scheduled to run until December 31, 2020 but that date can be changed. 

Although it is intended to be more convenient, riders must sign up with each service individually and can only be registered as part of the pilot with one company. In contrast to The RIDE, trip minimum costs are less than half of those of The Ride. On-demand trips can be booked on-demand while The Ride requires at least 1 day advanced notice and can only provide a 30-minute window for pickup and drop-off. The Ride also only offers reservations over the phone while the on-demand services all have a smartphone app and Lyft and Curb also allow bookings over the phone.
